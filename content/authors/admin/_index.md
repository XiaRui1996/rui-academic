I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at University of Cambridge ([Computational and Biological Learning Lab](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org)).  My supervisors are [Professor Guillaume Hennequin](https://www.cbl-cambridge.org/people/gjeh2) and [Dr Alberto Bernacchia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n48pFqcAAAAJ&hl=en).

My current project aims to study meta-learning from a dual machine-learning and biological perspective. My research interets also include probabilistic modelling, explainable AI and causal inference. I wish to develop trustworthy algorithms that combines fast and transferable learning, robustness, and interpretability.
